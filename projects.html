                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <h4>This is where I am going to be doing all my projects for the 2 weeks I have at the 2025 WPI Frontiers Program. I don't know how many I am going to be doing, but I will put my Progress in. </h4>
               <p> Day 1: We started with a Introduction Presentations about Networking and How it works. After, we started putting together our personal websites (the one I'm writing on right now). This was all beofre lunch and our Minor class (I have Legal considerations of New Technology, which is actually pretty interesting if you are into the history and the legal system. Though I don't really like how the class will be mostly on the US and Massachusettes while we have out-of-state and international student, but it's not like we have a lot of time to get everywhere.) We picked up on imported images, videos, and audios into our websites ( I had a bit of trouble with the audio but it's alright).</p>
