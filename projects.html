                Hi, This is my personal website. I used this during my 2025 expirence of WPI Frontiers program as I majored in Computer Science.

                <h4>This is where I am going to be doing all my projects for the 2 weeks I have at the 2025 WPI Frontiers Program. 
                    I don't know how many I am going to be doing, but I will put my Progress in. </h4>
               
                    <p> Day 1: We started with a Introduction Presentations about Networking and How it works. 
                     After, we started putting together our personal websites (the one I'm writing on right now).
                     This was all before lunch and our Minor class (I have Legal considerations of New Technology,
                     which is actually pretty interesting if you are into the history and the legal system.
                     Though I don't really like how the class will be mostly on the US and Massachusettes while we have out-of-state and
                     international student, but it's not like we have a lot of time to get everywhere.)
                     We picked up on imported images, videos, and audios into our websites (I had a bit of trouble with the audio but it's alright).</p>

               </video>
               <audio controls>
                   <source src="videos/Sneaky-snitch.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
               </audio>
               <p>This is what I used as my models for the day. I'm going to put more stuff in tomorrow hoppefully.</p>
               <br>
               <br>
                    <p> Day 2: We uploaded our projects to Github. Joana helped me with setting up my account and getting it done since she had
                     done it before. So far, it's been a really laidback class today. We'll see if it picks up. 
                     After lunch, we spent time on Web3school, doing tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. 
                     This is when we were told we had to do a demonstration in front of the class tomorrow. 
                     (I didn't like the sound of it since I have no idea what we were suppose to do a demonstration on and 
                     if it did include our personal websites, I don't want to share it to the class...)
                     <br> 
                     Afternoon Class: We worked a bit more on our websites before the TA taught us how we were able to make the background change 
                    colors using JAVASCRIPT as well as how to make a button to keep the color on the one that was written into the button. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                    <p> Day 3: On the schedule today is working on our websites and using the tutorial of Web3school for Javascript.
                     The demonstrations are voluntary so those that don't want to present their websites, do not have to (thankfully). 
                     They will apparently be presented at 2:00 in the afternoon class,
                     so those that do want to present have a bit more time to make any changes or fix any mistakes. </p>
